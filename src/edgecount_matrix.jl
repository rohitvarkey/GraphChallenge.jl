## Propose a new block assignment for the current node or block

### Parameters
    r : Int64
            current block assignment for the node under consideration
    neighbors_out : Array{Int64, 2}, has 2 columns.
            out neighbors for the block
    neighbors_in : Array{Int64, 2}, has 2 columns.
            in neighbors for the block
    b : Vector{Int64}
        array of block assignment for each node
    M : Array{Int64, 2}, size is (B, B)
            edge count matrix between all the blocks.
    d : Vector{Int}
            total number of edges to and from each block
    B : Int64
            total number of blocks
    agg_move : Bool
            whether the proposal is a block move

### Returns
    s : int
            proposed block assignment for the node under consideration
    k_out : int
            the out degree of the node
    k_in : int
            the in degree of the node
    k : int
            the total degree of the node

### Notes
- $d_u$: degree of block u

Randomly select a neighbor of the current node, and obtain its block assignment $u$. With probability $\frac{B}{d_u + B}$, randomly propose
a block. Otherwise, randomly selects a neighbor to block $u$ and propose its block assignment. For block (agglomerative) moves,
avoid proposing the current block.
